This repository talks about my end grade work, which is called "Implementación de algoritmos de conducción autónoma en vehículos a escala 1:10". This work is result of a two semesters investigation about the development of a 1:10 scaled autonomous vehicle. 
This system uses a commercial chassis for the vehicle, which uses an AVR microcontroller for the control of both degrees of freedom, finally the car has a Rock64 single board computer, and a Intel Realsense SR300 as a RGB-D sensor.
This repository divided in two main parts:
* Doc: With LaTeX documentation about the development of the project, including the main book, a poster, and the slides for the final presentation.
* Programas: All the codes involved in this project, taking the simulation codes, the AVR codes for the microcontroller and the libraries and main code executed by the Rock64.
In the developmnet of this project there were a list of objectives listed below
* Lane keeping using a PID control.
* Transit signals recognition using algorithms like SURF or SIFT.
* Both at the same time.
I know the objectives could be achieved only with AI or ML, however an implicit goal was to use another approach against the actual state-of-art work. So I hope this would help you and any question, commentary, complaint or suggestion can be shared with me.
